/**
 * This package contains classes for sampling from statistical distributions.
 *
 * <p>As of version 1.0, the code for specific distributions was adapted from
 * the corresponding classes in the development version of "Commons Math" (in
 * package {@code com.github.terefang.jmelange.apache.math4.distribution}).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When no specific algorithm is provided, one can still sample from any
 * distribution, using the <em>inverse method</em>, as illustrated in:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>{@link com.github.terefang.jmelange.apache.rng.sampling.distribution.InverseTransformDiscreteSampler InverseTransformDiscreteSampler}</li>
 *  <li>{@link com.github.terefang.jmelange.apache.rng.sampling.distribution.InverseTransformContinuousSampler InverseTransformContinuousSampler}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Algorithms are described in e.g. Luc Devroye (1986), <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/chapter_nine.pdf">chapter 9</a>
 * and <a href="http://luc.devroye.org/chapter_ten.pdf">chapter 10</a>.
 * This <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~wl/papers/07/csur07dt.pdf">paper</a> discusses Gaussian generators.
