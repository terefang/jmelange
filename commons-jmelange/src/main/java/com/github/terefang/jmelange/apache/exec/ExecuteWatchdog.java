/**
 * Destroys a process running for too long. For example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * ExecuteWatchdog watchdog = ExecuteWatchdog.builder().setTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30)).get();
 * Executor executor = DefaultExecutor.builder().setExecuteStreamHandler(new PumpStreamHandler()).get();
 * executor.setWatchdog(watchdog);
 * int exitValue = executor.execute(myCommandLine);
 * if (executor.isFailure(exitValue) &amp;&amp; watchdog.killedProcess()) {
 *     // it was killed on purpose by the watchdog
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * When starting an asynchronous process than 'ExecuteWatchdog' is the keeper of the process handle. In some cases it is useful not to define a timeout (and
 * pass {@link #INFINITE_TIMEOUT_DURATION}) and to kill the process explicitly using {@link #destroyProcess()}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please note that ExecuteWatchdog is processed asynchronously, e.g. it might be still attached to a process even after the
 * {@link DefaultExecutor#execute(CommandLine)} or a variation has returned.
