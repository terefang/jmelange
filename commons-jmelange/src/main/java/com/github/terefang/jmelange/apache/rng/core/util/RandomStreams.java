     * Creates a seed to prepend to a counter. The seed is created to satisfy the following

     * <li>The seed is composed of characters from an n-bit alphabet
     * <li>The character used in the least significant bits is unique
     * <li>The other characters are sampled uniformly from the remaining (n-1) characters
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The composed seed is created using {@code ((seed << shift) | count)}
     * where the shift is applied to ensure non-overlap of the shifted seed and
     * the count. This is achieved by ensuring the lowest 1-bit of the seed is
     * above the highest 1-bit of the count. The shift is a multiple of n to ensure
     * the character used in the least significant bits aligns with higher characters
     * after a shift. As higher characters exclude the least significant character
     * no shifted seed can duplicate previously observed composed seeds. This holds
     * until the least significant character itself is shifted out of the composed seed.
     *
     * <p>The seed generation algorithm starts with a random series of bits with the lowest bit
     * set. Any occurrences of the least significant character in the remaining characters are
     * replaced using {@link UniformRandomProvider#nextInt()}.
     *
     * <p>The remaining characters will be rejected at a rate of 2<sup>-n</sup>. The
     * character size is a compromise between a low rejection rate and the highest supported
     * count that may receive a prepended seed.
     *
     * <p>The JDK's {@code java.util.random} package uses 4-bits for the character size when
     * creating a stream of SplittableGenerator. This achieves a rejection rate
     * of {@code 1/16}. Using this size will require 1 call to generate a {@code long} and
     * on average 1 call to {@code nextInt(15)}. The maximum supported stream size with a unique
     * seed per object is 2<sup>60</sup>. The algorithm here also uses a character size of 4-bits;
     * this simplifies the implementation as there are exactly 16 characters. The algorithm is a
     * different implementation to the JDK and creates an output seed with similar properties.
