 * A string similarity score is intended to have <em>some</em> of the properties of a metric, yet allowing for exceptions, like the Jaro-Winkler similarity
 * score.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A similarity score is the function {@code d: [X * X] -&gt; [0, INFINITY)} with the following properties:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code d(x,y) &gt;= 0}, non-negativity or separation axiom</li>
 * <li>{@code d(x,y) == d(y,x)}, symmetry.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Notice, these are two of the properties that contribute to {@code d} being a metric.

 * @param <R> The type of similarity score unit used by this score.
